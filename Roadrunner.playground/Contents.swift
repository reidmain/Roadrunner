A Playground that will be used as a general scratchpad while working through Apple's iBook on Swift 2.2
Other more specific Playgrounds will probably be created to test out specific features of Swift and this one will be the most generic one to be used when I don't know where something should go.

// Thank god no println or @ symbols.
print("Hello, world!")
// Interesting that the first parameter is not named and is variadic. I guess it assumes everything up until a named variable is part of the variadic array. Pretty neat.
print("Hello, world!", "This is me printing multiple items.", "This is a very nice build in function.", separator: "\n", terminator: "Goodbye")
