// Strings Are Value Types. I'm writing this down in the hopes that I don't forget this at some crucial point in the future.
// "Behind the scenes, Swift‚Äôs compiler optimizes string usage so that actual copying takes place only when absolutely necessary. This means you always get great performance when working with strings as value types" I would love to know the details of how exactly it knows when it should copy and when it does not have to.

// Strings can be enumerated through easily and each character in the string is appropriately a Character object. And of course as I am typing this I am now just realizing that String does not conform to the SequenceType protocol. Fucking hell Apple book. Throw me a freakin' bone here. I'm the boss. Need the info.

Apple lies. Don't believe them when they say the + operator works on Character objects.

// String Interpolation

// However the expressions that can be written inside the parenthesis are limited which leads me to ask why use string interpolation at all? Why not just concatonate everything with the + operator? Maybe there is some performance hit to creating and concatonating all those strings versus interpolating a single one? Oh it is because if the expressions are not strings then you have to explicit create strings from them before you can concatonate them. So yeah interpolation is much cleaner.
