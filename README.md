When I was programming primarily in Objective-C I attempted to create a massive framework that I would use in all of my projects called [Silicon](https://github.com/reidmain/Silicon). I didn't make as much progress on it as I would have liked but now that I am working predominantly in Swift I have decided to take a second crack at it.

The name of this new framework will be "Roadrunner" named after the [eponymous character from Looney Tunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner) and because it is a very **swift** bird ðŸ˜‰.

One of the key points of this framework is that it is going to be developed in the [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) style. I am going to create dozens of modules that each have their own tests and example projects but then stitch them all together to create Roadrunner. You can read more about Uber's iOS team switching to a monorepo [here](https://eng.uber.com/ios-monorepo/).
